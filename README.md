# Covid-19_Vaccination_Visualizations
Effect of COVID-19 Vaccination: A Comparative Data Visualization Study
## Project Overview:

This project presents a comparative data visualization analysis to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on infection rates and death rates across three U.S. states: Alabama, Missouri, and New York.

The analysis focuses on pre- and post-vaccination periods, the emergence of new variants, and the effect of booster doses, using publicly available COVID-19 statistics to inform public-health decisions.

The visual evidence demonstrates a clear reduction in COVID-19 death rates and infection severity following widespread vaccination adoption. 

## Objectives:

Analyze COVID-19 death rates before and after vaccination rollout
Compare infection trends across states with varying vaccination coverage
Evaluate the impact of booster doses during new variant waves
Communicate insights through clear, policy-friendly visualizations

## Analytical Approach

### Data Collection
Public COVID-19 datasets aggregated by state and time period
Vaccination rates, infection counts, and death counts
### Data Processing
Monthly aggregation of cases and deaths
Normalization by population (rates per 100K where applicable)
Time-based segmentation (pre-vaccination, post-vaccination, booster phase)
### Visualization Strategy
Line charts showing monthly trends
Side-by-side state comparisons
Annotated vaccination milestones and variant periods

## Key Insights & Findings

Significant decline in COVID-19 death rates observed after vaccination rollout in 2021 across all three states. 
States with higher vaccination coverage (e.g., New York) showed lower and more stable death rates.
Despite the emergence of Omicron and new variants, booster doses contributed to controlling mortality trends in 2022
Infection rates dropped from ~4000 to under 500 cases per 100K population after vaccination expansion
